		"text": "Hello connections,\n I am excited to share that I have completed my first two AI/ML projects! Here’s a summary of what I worked on:\n\n1. Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning\n\nProject Overview:\nIn this project, I built a model to recognize handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The purpose of this project was to understand the basics of image recognition using deep learning techniques.\n\nSteps Involved:\n\nData Collection: Obtained the MNIST dataset containing images of handwritten digits.\nData Preprocessing: Standardized and normalized the pixel values to ensure better performance.\nData Augmentation: Applied techniques such as rotation and scaling to increase the diversity of the training data.\nSplitting the Data: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.\nTraining: Used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train the model on the training data.\nHyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the model by tuning parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs.\n\nThrough this project, I learned how to preprocess image data, implement a CNN, and apply data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.\n\n2. Titanic Survival Prediction using k-NN\n\nProject Overview:\nThe goal of this project was to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. This classification problem helped me understand how different factors influenced survival chances.\n\nSteps Involved:\n\nData Collection: Obtained the Titanic dataset containing details of passengers such as age, gender, class, etc.\nData Preprocessing: Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.\nFeature Scaling: Scaled features to ensure the k-NN algorithm performs optimally.\nTraining: Used the k-NN algorithm to train the model on the preprocessed data.\nHyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV to find the best values for k (number of neighbors) and p (distance metric).\n\nThis project helped me grasp the importance of data preprocessing, feature scaling, and the application of k-NN for classification problems.\n\nKey Learnings:\nUnderstanding the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering.\nImplementing and tuning machine learning algorithms for both image recognition and classification tasks.\nThe significance of hands-on practice in reinforcing theoretical knowledge.\n\nThanks to NxtWave for providing this wonderful course along with practical projects. The hands-on experience has been invaluable in helping me understand how the code works and apply ML concepts effectively.\n\nAdditionally, I have submitted the results of my Digit Recognizer project on Kaggle. Feel free to check it out!\n\nKaggle Profile: https://lnkd.in/dJXwPi67\n\nLooking forward to more exciting projects and learning opportunities in the field of AI/ML.\n\nhashtag#AI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#CNN hashtag#kNN hashtag#NxtWave hashtag#Kaggle hashtag#ProjectCompletion hashtag#python hashtag#coding",
